      <h1>EDUCATION<h1>
        <h4 style="color:"> University of Michigan, December 2015</h4>
        <h4> Bachelors of Science, Computer Science</h4>

      <h1>WORK EXPERIENCE<h1>
        <h4> Intern Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Detroit</h4>
        <h4 style="color:gray;"> June-September 2015</h4>
        <p> I worked with several teams including the Data Management and Digital Experience Teams as an Intern at the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. During my time at Blue Cross, I delivered a report to company executives, which analyzed the mobile capabilities of Health Insurance competitors. During my time compiling the report, I was able to identify mobile health trends including marketing and design approaches in addition to analyzing customer feedback. To help complete my report, I was able to leverage my programming skills to generate visuals for and measure the effects of individual capabilities on customer satisfaction. Likewise, the report identified potential voids in the mobile market that BCBSM could leverage to separate themselves from their competition. In addition to analyzing mobile competition, I designed and implemented the front-end and prototype of a possible application that members could use to view their vital information and monitor their physical fitness. On the business analytics side, I was able to work with IBM's business analytics software Cognos.

        <h1>PROJECTS<h1>

        <h4>Palet</h4>
        <h4 style="color:gray;"> May 2015</h4>
        <h5>iPhone/iPad (Swift)</h5>
        <p>Early in the summer I started developing in interest in mobile applications and UI design and so I thought I'd pick up some HTML/CSS/Javsscript. Likewise, I was creating graphics in Adobe Illustrator and using some of the same colors from Illustrator for web designs when I noticed how annoying it was to keep flipping through multiple applications and copying color hex-codes. I saw a mobile application that would serve as a small third workspace window as a way of increasing productivity when doing such tasks and so I developed Palet!, a mobile application with the ability to save colors and customize as many color schemes as the user decided. Palet was the very first mobile application that I developed and forced me to learn Swift and a little Objective-C and introduced me to some of the processes involved in creating mobile applications.
       <br><br>

        <h4> Mine Escape</h4>
        <h4 style="color:gray;"> June 2015</h4>
        <h5>iPhone/iPad (Swift)</h5>
        <p> During the summer I was brainstorming ideas for mobile applications when I came across the idea of creating a short-term and sensory-memory aid that would be easy to use by both children and adults. I thought the easiest way to implement this would be through a simple tap-game. Likewise, I saw some elements in MineSweeper that I thought I could apply to the game, particularly its clean interface and ability to easily scale levels in size by simply increasing the dimensions of the game grid. However, I found that MineSweeper was more of a thinking game than a memory game and was a bit too slow-paced for a 9 year old to have any interest playing. This forced me to think about the types of games I used to enjoy playing when I was 9. One of those games was 'Match', where you are rewarded for remembering the locations of certain images. I developed MineEscape! to combine the sensory-memory of match with the basic interface and difficulty-scalability of MineSweeper. 
          <br><br>

        <h4>Sphaudio</h4>
        <h4 style="color:gray;"> December 2015</h4>
        <h5>iPhone/iPad, Web (Objective-C) </h5>
        <p>My latest application, Sphaudio (Spherical Audio) renders spheres in a three-dimensional space according to waveform data to provide an asthetically pleasing audio visualizer. The application uses the EZAudio framework to gather frequency and waveform data from the device's audio files which is then mapped to spherical objects which animate accordig to the data. The application uses the iOS device's library as the audio data source and thus the user is free to visualize any of the songs in his or her itunes music library. Likewise, the application also includes  customization options.
